# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/rails/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rails/log/*
!/rails/log/.keep
/rails/tmp

# Ignore application configuration
/rails/config/application.yml

.DS_Store
/rails/.DS_Store
